# You are going to write a method called passthrough
# It receives an enumerable object, and an initial passthrough value
# 
# For each of the elements in the enumerable object,
# it yields the passthrough value and the object
# whatever the block returns, must be passed in as the next passthrough value for the next element
#
# After we go through all the elements, the last passthrough value is returned to the caller
#
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# passthrough 5..10 , 0 do |sum,num|
#   sum + num
# end
# 
# This should return 45 in the following manner:
#   The first time the block is passed    0 ,  5 and it returns 5
#   The second time the block is passed   5 ,  6 and it returns 11
#   The third time the block is passed   11 ,  7 and it returns 18
#   The fourth time the block is passed  18 ,  8 and it returns 26
#   The fourth time the block is passed  26 ,  9 and it returns 35
#   The fourth time the block is passed  35 , 10 and it returns 45
#   The method then returns 45

#   words[word.length] ||= Array.new
#   words[word.length] << word
#   words
# end
# 
# should return {5=>["hound"], 6=>["around"], 3=>["the", "fox", "and", "the", "ran", "all"]}

# married_couples = { 'Smith' => ['John' , 'Sally'] , 'Jones' => ['Will','Robert'] }
#
# passthrough married_couples , Array.new do |people,(last_name,first_names)|
#   full_names = first_names.map { |first_name| "#{first_name} #{last_name}" }
#   people + full_names
# end
# 
# should return ["Will Jones", "Robert Jones", "John Smith", "Sally Smith"]

# Added in real inject behavior ;)
